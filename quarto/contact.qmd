# Bug Reporting

Bug fixing is always a priority for the PAMGuard team. Known issues are listed on
out gitHub pages [here](https://github.com/PAMGuard/PAMGuard/issues);

If you think you've found a bug, please let us know by emailing
[pamguard\@st-andrews.ac.uk](mailto:pamguard@st-andrews.ac.uk) including the 
following information.

1. Operating system (windows, Mac, etc.)
2. PAMGuard version
3. The text from the command window (See below for more on this)
4. Any information on what you were doing that creates the bug
5. If possible, include the psfx file you were using


## Getting the command window text
Please don't send a screenshot of this. The information we need has usually scrolled 
off the visible window, so get us the full text. 

### Windows 10 or earlier
1. Right click on the title bar
2. Select Edit > Select All as per the picture below
![PAMGuard command window with debug text](./images/cmdselect.png)
3. Now the text should be highlighted
4. Go back to the Edit and select copy.
5. Paste the text into an email, or save and attach to email.

### Windows 11
1. Highlight text in the command window with the mouse
2. Right click and select 'copy'
3. Paste into an email

### Or send the log file
By default, PAMGuard will be logging all of the information written to the command 
window in a log file in your user directory. This will be in a 
folder something along the lines of C:\\Users\\**yourusername**\\Pamguard.

The folder can be most easily accessed from the PAMGuard Help/Log File menu.
Identify the correct file (note that times in the file names are in UTC) and 
either attach the file to an email, or copy the text into the body of 
an email to [pamguard\@st-andrews.ac.uk](mailto:pamguard@st-andrews.ac.uk).
