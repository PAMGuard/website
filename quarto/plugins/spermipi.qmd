## Sperm Whale IPI Measurement

The "Sperm whale IPI Plugin" (AKA IPI plugin) is an external plugin for measuring the Inter-Pulse Interval (IPI) of the clicks of sperm whales. Measurement of IPI has been demonstrated to be a reliable means of estimating the total length of an individual sperm whale (Gordon 1991; Growcott et al 2011). The module employs two related signal processing methods, both based on cepstral analysis of clicks, to estimate IPI.

See the online help for further details.
