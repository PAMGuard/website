## Windows MM Sound: Windows Native Sound Card Access

The Javasound system, that's been used in PAMGuard since it's start in 2013, has some annoying limitations:

1.  It won't work with 24 bit sound cards
2.  It won't work with sound card sample rates \> 192kHz.

To overcome these limitations, we've developed a small plugin acquisition module that uses lower level Windows libraries and thereby provides more flexibility for accessing sound cards on Windows systems.
