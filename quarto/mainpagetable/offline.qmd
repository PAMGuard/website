When processing data back at the lab, PAMGuard can process data at many times real time. This is great for processing data from autonomous recorders or for reprocessing old data from ship based surveys with the latest algorithms.

The PAMGuard Viewer allows you to scroll through the detection data and further annotate the automatic detections.
