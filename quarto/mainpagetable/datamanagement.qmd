PAMGuard stores data in a .sqlite database and bespoke files called 'Binary' files - this provides a balance between some human readable data and allowing allowing us to access detection data efficiently so that uswers can reprocess result and rapidly explore and visualize large datasets.

Recently we have being working hard to make PAMGuard compliant with acoustic metadata standard and to integrate the \[Tethys metadata system\](<https://tethys.sdsu.edu/>). You can find some more about the project \[here\](<https://wildlabs.net/discussion/unifying-acoustic-metadata>).
