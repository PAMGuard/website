## Northeast Atlantic Classifier

When used together to classify encounters containing multiple vocalizations, these ROCCA classifiers performed with an overall accuracy of 78%, ranging from 60% for Grampus griseus encounters to 92% for Orcinus orca encounters. The following seven species can be identified: 

*	Atlantic white-sided dolphin (_Lagenorhynchus acutus_) 
*	Common bottlenose dolphin (_Tursiops truncatus_) 
*	Killer whale (_Orcinus orca_) 
*	Long-finned pilot whale (_Globicephala melas_) 
*	Risso’s dolphin (_Grampus griseus_) 
*	Short-beaked common dolphin (_Delphinus delphis_) 
*	White-beaked dolphin (_Lagenorhynchus albirostris_)

### Models 

Northeast Atlantic ROCCA click and whistle classifiers can be found on Zenodo: [zenodo.org/records/14936662](https://zenodo.org/records/14936662).
Separate click and whistle predictions are intended to be combined for final species classification via an R application (see README file) also accessible through the Zenodo download. Also included in the download are a PAMGuard settings file (.psfx) for ROCCA and a README file in the download containing documentation, tutorials, and extra information.
