## PAMGuard Source Code

PAMGUARD is open source software licensed under the 
[GNU General Public License V3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)
from the Free Software Foundation.

PAMGuard is mostly written in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
which provides a good balance between speed, flexibility, and ease of development. 

Interfaces to external instruments, for example National Instruments data acquisition
devices, are often written in C/C++ and accessed from the Java code using 
the [Java Native Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Interface) or 
use [Java Native Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Access) to 
communicate with device manufacturers C libraries. 

All PAMGuard source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/PAMGuard).

## Use of Eclipse

Many PAMGuard developers use the Eclipse IDE for code development. [Click here for instructions](./pdf/Setting%20up%20with%20GIT.pdf) on how to configure Eclipse with a GIT repository.

## Assistance

Information on the [PAMGuard API](./api/index.html) and on how to make PAMGuard [modules](devmodules.html) and [plug-ins](devplugins.html) is available on this web site.

The PAMGuard team have limited time to spend assisting developers if the development project is in line with the interests of our current sponsors.
