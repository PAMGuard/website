PAMGuard Tutorials are an excellent way to familiarise yourself with PAMGuard.
If you're new to PAMGuard, you should start with one of the introductory turotials, 
[Getting Started](./tutorials/getstarted.qmd), 
or [Introduction to PAMGuard](./tutorials/staticmonitoring.qmd) before trying the 
more advanced ones. 


The tutorials all use freely available pre-recorded sound files and will run on any [compatible computer](systemreq.qmd) without the need for specialist equipment.

Subject to [funding](funding.qmd), we're currently trying to expand these to cover more areas of what PAMGuard can do.
