### Getting Started with PAMGuard

The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a basic overview of how to use PAMGuard, including adding and configuring plug-in modules.

The main learning outcomes are:

1.  Loading and running PAMGuard configurations
2.  Navigating the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
3.  Basic Map familiarisation
4.  Running and configuring a Click Detector module
5.  Adding and configuring User Display panels
6.  Adding, configuring and running a Whistle Detector
7.  Using “Ishmael” modules for Energy Sum, Spectrogram Correlation and Matched Filter detectors.
8.  Overlaying detector graphics on display panels
9.  Adding and configuring FFT Engines 10.Using spectrogram and radar displays to view detection information

These learning outcomes can be achieved through a series of exercises that now follow.

The exercises can be seen as a guide, so you’re encouraged to experiment with PAMGuard as you work through each one.
