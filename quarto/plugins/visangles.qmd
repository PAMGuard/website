## Visual Angles

Converts visual angle and range estimates from observers at the front of a vessel to an estimate of the angle and range from a hydrophone array some distance behind. Also works in reverse.

It's a PAMGuard plugin, so to deploy, simply take the built jar file from the 'releases' and copy it to the plugins folder of your PAMGuard installation. The additional module will then appear in the Visual Methods section of the add modules menu.

Calculated angles will be stored to the database and displayed on the map. Not that PG Verision 2.02.10 has a bug in the map display, so upgrade to a later version.
