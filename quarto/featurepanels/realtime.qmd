PAMGuard can process data in real time using a wide range of Detection, Classification, and Localisation algorithms, combined with sophisticated user displays.

It is widely used on vessels of many sizes, from tiny vessels with a laptop in a small waterproof case, to large ships.

Data input can come from a wide range of devices, from a simple computer sound card, to specialist high frequency data acquisition systems.

Read in [this research article](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229058) how we built a system that was used to monitor twelve high frequency hydrophones at a sample rate of 500kHz for over a year.
