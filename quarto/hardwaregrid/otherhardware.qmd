PAMGuard supports a number fo hardware devices for real time operation. Therese include most [National Instrument DAQ devices](<https://www.ni.com/en/shop/data-acquisition.html?srsltid=AfmBOopwKj-Wua7rhFqYul-_llp2Eomc8iyMvniYQprwnpYBJVIoqStC>), [SAIL DAQ cards](<https://www.smruconsulting.com/daq>) and most commercial ASIO and standard sound cards. PAMGuard also has several modules for reading analogue orientation and depth data and several [plugins](../pluginmodules.html) that support more bespoke hardware devices.

As well as real time operation PAMGuard also supports importing numerous data formats. Flac and sud files (from [SoundTraps](<https://www.oceaninstruments.co.nz/>)) can be directly read by PAMGuard without the need for decompressing files, saving significant hard disk space. PAMGuard can also read bespoke detection devices such as data from [CPODs/FPODs](<https://www.chelonia.co.uk/>).


Note that the Windows version of PAMGuard supports all hardware
