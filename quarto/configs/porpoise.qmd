### Porpoise Click Detection
A simple configuration for a boat based porpoise survey comprising modules to collect basic
navigation data from GPS and a Click Detector  setup to detect in the porpoise frequency range. 

### Usage Notes
NMEA Collection should be changed to your own source, at the moment it is simulated. If you are using a sound card with more than two channels, or other than the primary sound card, Sound Acquisition should be edited to reflect this.
