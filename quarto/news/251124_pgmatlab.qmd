We're pleased to announce the availability of pgmatlab version 2.0.0: a library to read binary output files produced by PAMGuard into Matlab.

We've also fully updated the [user tutorial](../tutorials/matlabrpython/ProcessingPGDFs.html) demonstrating how to read PAMGuard binary files using Matlab, R, or Python.

Please report any bugs to the [PAMGuardMatlab GitHub repository](https://github.com/PAMGuard/PAMGuardMatlab).
