[Tethys](https://tethys.sdsu.edu/) is a temporal-spatial database for metadata related to passive acoustic studies. Unlike the PAMGuard databases, which hold a lot of detail about a single dataset, a Tethys database can hold summary data for many projects -- that can be every project for you as an individual, your lab, or for multiple labs across a larger organisation.

Tethys does not replace existing PAMGuard databases and binary storage system since it's not possible to get the level of detail PAMGuard uses during analysis into a single general database. However, the intent is that Tethys will contain enough detail for extensive meta-analysis across large temporal and spatial scales, eliminating (or at least minimising) the requirement for researchers to go back to the original PAMGuard data sets.

### Learning Outcomes

You will learn how to export data from PAMGuard to a Tethys database and to view the exported data both within PAMGuard and through the Tethys web interface.

1.  Install Tethys and launch the Tethys Server
2.  Add a Tethys module to PAMGuard and connect to the Tethys Server
3.  Export data from PAMGuard to Tethys, including:
    -   Calibration data
    -   Deployment data
    -   Detections
4.  View the exported data both from within PAMGuard and using the Tethys Web client

### Prerequisites

The exercises in these tutorials are compatible with PAMGuard Version 2.02.16 and Tethys Version 3.2 beta 2. 

Three slightly different tutorials are available. Which you select will depend on your level of experience. 
All require a reasonable working knowledge of PAMGuard. If you are not already familiar with PAMGuard, you should first complete the tutorial [Introduction to PAMGuard](staticmonitoring.qmd).

If you're new to Tethys, you should start with the [Full Tethys Tutorial](https://github.com/PAMGuardLearning/pamguard_tethys/releases/download/V1.2/PAMGuard-Tethys-Tutorial_1.2.pdf) which will guide you on setting up Tethys and PAMGuard and will also direct you to other Tethys learning materials.

If you've used Tethys in the past, then you can go to the
[Tethys in a Hurry](https://github.com/PAMGuardLearning/pamguard_tethys/releases/download/V1.2/tethys_in_a_hurry_1.2.pdf) tutorial, which will get straight into exporting data without the preamble. 

If you've completed either of the above tutorials and have also completed the [Batch Processing Tutorial](batchprocessing.qmd)
 then you might want to look at the [Batch Output Tutorial](https://github.com/PAMGuardLearning/pamguard_tethys/releases/download/V1.2/batch_output_to_tethys_1.2.pdf). This will teach you how to output multiple data streams from multiple PAMGuard datasets in one big batch job, without having to add a Tethys module to every PAMGuard dataset individually.
