The PAMGuard team are pleased to announce the release of a plugin detection module for the 
[Scottish Wild Haggis](https://haggiswildlifefoundation.com/) *Haggis Scoticus*.

See [Plugin downloads](../pluginmodules.qmd) for further details. 

Next year, should we be able to obtain sufficient high quality and  verified training data, we hope to build an AI classifier for the megafauna of Loch Ness.
