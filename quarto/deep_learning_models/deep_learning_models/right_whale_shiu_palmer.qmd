## Introduction

This is a spectrogram based model for detecting right whale up-sweeps developed by Shiu and Palmer et al. (2020). The model was tested on a standardised dataset from the DCLDE conference in 2013 (Detection, Classification, Localisation, and Density Estimation)to quantify the performance compared to other leading automated analysis approaches. Shiu/Palmeret al.â€™s deep learning approach outperformed all those efforts by a very wide margin (see Figure 1 in their paper) and was an eraly deomstration of the potential of deep learning appraoched in marine bioacoustics. Note that this model is also available as an example model within PAMGuard.
