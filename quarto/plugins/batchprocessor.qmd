## PAMGuard Batch Processor

**The batch processor module currently only works on Windows**

The Batch Processing module can be used to run the same configuration file on multiple datasets using the same psfx file without having to go into the configuration for every dataset to change the location of the source files, the output database name, and the location of the binary store.

It is particularly useful for processing datasets from deployments of multiple autonomous recorders, but also has application in reprocessing of any data where you want to run the same PAMGuard algorithms on multiple sets of data.

The latest version can now also run Viewer Mode offline tasks, such as click reclassification, or bulk output of data to a Tethys database.
