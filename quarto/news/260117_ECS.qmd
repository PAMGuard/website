The [European Cetacean Society annual conference](https://www.europeancetaceansociety.eu/conference-2026) is coming to Scotland in the week of 20 April 2026.

On the Monday or Tuesday, we'll be holding a PAMGuard training workshop at the conference centre. This will be aimed at people who are new, or relatively new, to PAMGuard.

If there is sufficient demand, we may also organise something for more advanced users. Please contact the PAMGuard team if you think this would be of interest.

Keep and eye on the [conference website](https://www.europeancetaceansociety.eu/conference-2026) for updates and registration details.
