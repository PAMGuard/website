Tethys is a temporal-spatial database for metadata related to passive acoustic studies. Unlike the PAMGuard databases, which hold a lot of detail about a single dataset, a Tethys database can hold summary data for many projects -- that can be every project for you as an individual, your lab, or for multiple labs across a larger organisation.

Tethys does not replace existing PAMGuard databases and binary storage system since it's not possible to get the level of detail PAMGuard uses during analysis into a single general database. However, the intent is that Tethys will contain enough detail for extensive meta-analysis across large temporal and spatial scales, eliminating (or at least minimising) the requirement for researchers to go back to the original PAMGuard data sets.

### Learning Outcomes

You will learn how to export data from PAMGuard to a Tethys database and to view the exported data both within PAMGuard and through the Tethys web interface.

1.  Install Tethys and launch the Tethys Server
2.  Add a Tethys module to PAMGuard and connect to the Tethys Server
3.  Export data from PAMGuard to Tethys, including:
    -   Calibration data
    -   Deployment data
    -   Detections
4.  View the exported data both from within PAMGuard and using the Tethys Web client
