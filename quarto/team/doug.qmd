[Dr Douglas
Gillespie](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/biology/people/dg50/) completed
a PhD in particle physics and worked at [CERN](https://home.cern/)
before joining the IFAW research team and their vessel [Song of the
Whale](https://www.marineconservationresearch.co.uk/rv-song-of-the-whale/).

In the late 1990's, he wrote the [Rainbow Click and Logger
software](https://www.marineconservationresearch.co.uk/downloads/logger-2000-rainbowclick-software-downloads/)
which are very much the predecessors of modern day PAMGuard.

Doug is now a Principal Research Fellow in the [Sea Mammal Research
Unit](https://www.smru.st-andrews.ac.uk/index.html) at the University of
St Andrews, Scotland.

Doug spends about half his time developing new functionality for
PAMGuard and the other half using it to study marine mammals around the
world.
