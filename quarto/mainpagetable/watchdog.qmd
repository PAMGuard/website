Should PAMGuard crash, or there be a Windows restart, or a power failure at the PC, PAMDog will get PAMGuard going again.

PAMDog is installed with PAMGuard on Windows machines, but you will have to enable it, but creating a shortcut in your startup menu. Read how to do this in the [help files](../olhelp/overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/PamdogHelp.html).
