### New Features

Rocca update: Ability to specify whether strong whistle/encounter threshold is applied as an absolute value, or as the difference between the highest and second-highest votes.

Tethys: Export of Group3D Localiser data

### Bug Fixes

Ishmael Matched Filter detector. Improved correlation algorithm to use correct data normalisation (and a faster FFT).

Ishamel detector graphics. Improved graphics (spectrogram plugins) to work when scrolling the spectrogram and to have better automatic scaling.

Folder processing: At startup, while PAMGuard catalogues the sound files, a progress bar is shown. This doesn’t change anything, or speed up the process, but does at least let the user know what’s happening (Issue 156).

No sound card ? If no sound cards are present on your computer (or if no headphones are attached, even though a sound card is present) when processing files offline, PAMGuard will still slow the analysis rate as it would if a soundcard were present.

Click Detector click selection on the display. Fixed issue with wrong click being selected when display was highly zoomed in (Issue 158).

File processing. Sometimes only processing last file when reprocessing data (issue 162).

Added ability for exporter to read annotations. Added ability to export CPOD and FPOD data.

Fixed various bugs in CPOD and FPOD displays and importer. Updated CPOD help file.
