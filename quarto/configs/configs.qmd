PAMGuard saves it's configuration in special configuration files, ending in .psfx. 
Each file contains the list of [modules](../coremodules.html) 
and displays you've chosen to use and the settings for each module. 

A typical user may have many configuration files, set up for different purposes. Users 
often share configuration files and companies providing services such as
acoustic observers to industry will typically provide the observers with the PAMGuard
configuration they want them to use. 

Here we provide a sample of simple configuration files, that might help you get started. 

You should also visit the [tutorials pages](../tutorials.html) which will show
you how to build your own configurations.
