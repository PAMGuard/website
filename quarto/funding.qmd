Initial funding for the PAMGuard project came from the International Association of Geophysical Contractors [Sound and Marine Life Joint Industry Programme](https://www.soundandmarinelife.org/)

Funding for more recent developments has come from a wide variety of sources including governments, other research organisations, offshore renewable energy companies, and NGO's.

Many developments such as the [Tritech multibeam sonar module](./plugins/tritech.qmd), and the latest [ROCCA Classifiers](./rocca/rocca.qmd), occur because we need those developments to fulfill our own research goals.

While these mechanisms fund some of the developments, they do not pay for time we spend on user support, dealing with bugs, managing new releases and updating this website.

In 2016 we set up a system of [voluntary contributions](voluntary.qmd), whereby users within the offshore industry (oil and gas, renewables) would pay a contribution to PAMGuard of US\$5 per day.

We are now setting up a much simpler system whereby companies can easily [donate to PAMGuard](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/development/pamguard/) through the Universities Science and Medicine donation form (please ensure you select PAMGuard from the list of funding designations!).

### How we'll spend the money

Subject to having enough funds to employ a new programmer / assistant, important areas we want to work on in the coming 12 months are

1.  Continued user support
2.  Improvement in pre-release testing
3.  Updated user tutorials
4.  New Installers for Windows ARM Processors
5.  Better support for Mac computers, including real time processing
6.  Further updates to this website
