### Clicks and Whistles
A configuration that runs two different detectors at once. The first detects clicks
from sperm whales and the second runs a tonal noise detector. 

### Usage Notes
NMEA Collection should be changed to your own source, at the moment it is simulated. If you are using a sound card with more than two channels, or other than the primary sound card, Sound Acquisition should be edited to reflect this.
