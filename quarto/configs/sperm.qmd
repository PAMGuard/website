### Sperm Whale Detection

Simple sperm whale detector using data input from the system sound card.

### Usage Notes
NMEA Collection should be changed to your own source, at the moment it is simulated. If you are using a sound card with more than two channels, or other than the primary sound card, Sound Acquisition should be edited to reflect this.
