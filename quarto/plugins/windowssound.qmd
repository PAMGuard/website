## Windows MM Sound: Windows Native Sound Card Access

This is a PAMGuard DAQ plugin to acquire sound card data through low level C functions from the Windows Multimedia API.

It provides better support for Windows sound cards than is available through the JavaSound library built into PAMGuard.

In particular, it provides support for 24 bit sound cards and for sample rates \> 192kHz, if appropriate hardware is available.

Once installed, PAMGuard will automatically add this system to the list of available DAQ systems in the PAMGuard sound acquisition module.

Before using this module, read the notes in the help about 
[correctly configuring sound cards](https://www.pamguard.org/olhelp/sound_processing/AcquisitionHelp/docs/AcquisitionSoundCard.html);

Note that this is a new module and has only been tested on a limited number of Windows 11 computers. Please report any problems or errors to [support\@pamguard.org](mailto:support@pamguard.org){.email}, including the type of sound card you were using, the Windows version, PAMGuard version, and the error messages from the command window or [log files](https://www.pamguard.org/olhelp/overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/logfiles.html).
