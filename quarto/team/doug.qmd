![Doug Gillespie](./images/dg50.jpeg)

[Dr Douglas Gillespie](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/biology/people/dg50/) 
completed a PhD in particle physics and worked at [CERN](https://home.cern/)
before joining the IFAW research team and their vessel 
[Song of the Whale](https://www.marineconservationresearch.co.uk/rv-song-of-the-whale/).

In the late 1990's, he wrote the [Rainbow Click and Logger software](https://www.marineconservationresearch.co.uk/downloads/logger-2000-rainbowclick-software-downloads/)
which are very much the predecessors of modern day PAMGuard. 

Doug spends about half his time developing new functionality for PAMGuard and the
other half using it to study marine mammals around the world.
