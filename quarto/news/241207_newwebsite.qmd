We're pleased to bring you a new look PAMGuard website which 
will be easier for us to manage and easier for you to navigate. 

The new site 
has been developed using the open source tools from 
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and is being hosted on GitHub pages. 

We hope that you find the new site easy to navigate and that you can get
the [PAMGuard downloads](../downloadsurvey.qmd) and information that you want. 

If there was anything on the old site that you think we've left out, please
get in touch.
