## Available Plugin Modules

These are [Plugin modules](../pluginmodules.qmd) developed by the PAMGuard team, or hosted on our website. Other developers may distribute plugins from their own sites.

### Installation

Usually, a plugin is distributed in the form of a .jar file (that's compiled Java, the language PAMGuard is written in). All you have to do is copy the file into the plugins folder in the PAMGuard installation directory (e.g. C:\\Program Files\\Pamguard\\plugins for most installation). In some cases, you may need to add other files, for example some additional C libraries. In this case check any instructions distributed with the plugin.

We attempt to ensure that these plugins remain compatible with the latest released version of PAMGuard.
